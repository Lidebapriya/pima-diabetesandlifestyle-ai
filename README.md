# Pima Diabetes AI Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes using the **Pima Indian Diabetes dataset**, enriched with **synthetic lifestyle features** such as sleep, stress, physical activity, diet, and water intake. The model is built using **Python** and **machine learning** (Random Forest Classifier) to provide a simple yet effective prediction system.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:

### Clinical Features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (target variable: 0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes)

### Lifestyle Features (Added for originality):
- sleep_hours: Average hours of sleep per night
- stress_level: Stress level (1â€“10 scale)
- physical_activity_mins: Daily exercise in minutes
- food_processed: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (consumption of processed foods)
- water_liters: Average daily water intake in liters
- family_history: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (family history of diabetes)

> These additional columns make the dataset **unique and portfolio-ready**.

## Model
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Purpose:** Predict diabetes outcome (0 or 1)  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
