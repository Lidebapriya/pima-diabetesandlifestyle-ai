## What’s Included
- **Dataset:** Medical info + lifestyle features (sleep, stress, exercise, water intake, diet, family history)  
- **Notebook:** Step-by-step Python code to train a simple AI model  
- **Model:** A machine learning model that predicts diabetes  

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Upload the dataset CSV  
3. Run all the cells to see the model predictions  

## Why It’s Useful
- Helps understand how AI can predict health risks  
- Shows your skills in Python, AI, and handling datasets  
- Great for building a portfolio for jobs in tech and healthcare
